# IoT-Table-Lamp-using-AWS-IoT
implementation of an Internet of things enabled table lamp. The table lamp works in two modes, firstly Bluetooth control mode, secondly motion detection mode. The sensor values from the PIR sensor are sent to Amazon Web Serviceâ€™s IoT web console where it can be further processed. Here the author sends the value to AWS Simple Notification Service which notifies the user if there is motion present via an email.


The Smart Table lamp is based on Internet of things  technology, Blueetooth and Motion Detection using PIR sensors.
The components we have used are:
Arduino microcontroller
2-Channel Opt-coupler Relay
 HC-SR501 PIR Sensor
HC-05 Bluetooth SPP module
 Raspberry Pi 3
 LM35 Temperature Sensor
 Incandescent Bulb
 16x2 LCD Display
 Pushbutton
10k ohm Pot
 1k Resistor
 Jumpers and Breadboard
